## UX
The overall design of the website is orientated towards the chatbot mascot colour theme. Using dark blue for the content and light seashell for the background, this mininalism design ensures distinctive contrast between content and background. The thought process in designing the website is to addresses the following:

            1. Problem Statements
            2. Highlight of Key Features 
            3. Explanation of Features
            4. Communications
           
 <br />

### Problem Statements and Key Features
The default page of the website brings up a caroursel effect of different problem statements, followby the highlights on key features of the telegram chatbot and lastly a youtube video demostration of the chatbot in action. Each caroursel captures different kind of user experiences in looking for carpark lots whereas the highlight in key features is to entice users to read further on how these features can be achieved. The demostration will give a quick run through to the user on how the telegraph chatbot work in action.
